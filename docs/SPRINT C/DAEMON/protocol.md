## 4. Communication protocol

* Tcp connection must be established
* Uses the client-server model. The client application (Shared Board App) is the one that takes
  the initiative of requesting a TCP connection establishment with the counterpart server
  application, which should accept incoming connection requests.
* Once established, the TCP connection between the client and the server is kept alive and is used
  for all required data exchanges while the client application is running
* Every request (sent by the client or the server) has a mandatory response (correspondingly sent
  by the server or the client).
