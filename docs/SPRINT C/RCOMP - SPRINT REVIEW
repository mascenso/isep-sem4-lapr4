=========================================
### Sprint master: 1100358 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #

T.2.1 OSPF based dynamic routing
T.2.1 DHCPv4 service
T.2.1 VoIP service
T.2.1 Adding a second server to each DMZ network to run the HTTP service.
T.2.1 Configuring DNS servers to establish a DNS domains tree.
T.2.1 Enforcing NAT (Network Address Translation).
T.2.1 Establishing traffic access policies on routers (static firewall).

# 2. Subtasks assessment #

## 2.1. 1201951 - OSPF, DHCPv4, VoIP, DMZ & HTTP service, NAT, Firewall for Building A and Campus  #

* The DNS was not fully functional, maybe with more time I could find the problem but with the workload we have I could not confirm where the error was.
* The failure to complete the pl forms in time may have caused greater difficulty in solving these problems.

### Strengths as a team

* We all work in cooperation to successfully complete the project on time;
* Consistent technical decisions among the various group members and meeting the fundamental technical requirements;
* IPv4 networks' addresses well established from the previous sprints.

### Issues as a team

* High volume of assignments,  which poses challenges in effectively managing our time.
* Making pls earlier would have helped to solve some situations;



## 2.2. 1210857 - OSPF, DHCPv4, VoIP, DMZ & HTTP service, NAT, Firewall for Building B  #
### Partially implemented with issues. ###

* Unfortunately it was not possible to complete the implementation of the firewalls since it was not possible to do the ACL implementation, probably due to the subinterfaces.
* Also, the OSPF didn't worked in building A and we weren't able to figure out the reason.

### Strengths as a team

* Good team communication, commitment and coordination, some information was decided early in the sprint;
* Consistent technical decisions among the various group members and meeting the fundamental technical requirements;


### Issues as a team

* High volume of assignments, which poses challenges in effectively managing our time;
* Resolving the PLs earlier would have helped to solve some situations;


## 2.3. 1210855 - OSPF, DHCPv4, VoIP, DMZ & HTTP service, NAT, Firewall for Building C  #
### Totally implemented with issues. ###

### Strengths as a team

* Good team communication, commitment and coordination, some information was decided early in the sprint;
* Consistent technical decisions among the various group members and meeting the fundamental technical requirements;
* Consistent design with the building plannings developed on Sprint 1.
* IPv4 networks' addresses well established from Sprint 2.

### Issues as a team

* High volume of assignments,  which poses challenges in effectively managing our time.
* An unknown problem occured with VoIP configuration on Building C, which led to a large amount of rework.
* No success on reached http server by its name, only through IP address
* Making pls earlier would have helped to solve some situations;


## 2.4. 1100358 - OSPF, DHCPv4, VoIP, DMZ & HTTP service, NAT, Firewall for Building D  #
### Totally implemented with issues. ###

* Consistent design with the building plannings developed on Sprint 1.
* IPv4 networks' addresses well established from Sprint 2.

### Strengths as a team

* We all work in cooperation to successfully complete the project on time;
* Consistent technical decisions among the various group members and meeting the fundamental technical requirements;
* Consistent design with the building plannings developed on Sprint 1.
* IPv4 networks' addresses well established from Sprint 2.

### Issues as a team

* Some decisions could be better justified on file readme;
* High volume of assignments,  which poses challenges in effectively managing our time.
* Making pls earlier would have helped to solve some situations;
