=========================================
### Sprint master: 1100358 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #

The Shared Board Protocol:
 * SBP description;
 * SBP message format:
 * SBP message codes;

User authentication;
Implement an HTTP server to be able to generate the "views" of the boards. This should be done automatically, without the intervention of the users, by using AJAX.

# 2. Subtasks assessment #

In this sprint, the Shared Board Protocol and the HTTP implementation were analyzed, discussed, and implemented (or tried to) by all the team members enrolled in this UC,
so this sprint review has no subtasks per se.
All the members, at a given time, were involved in this issue(s).

Unfortunately, we were unable to implement the HTTP server as requested. The high volume of assignments, which poses challenges in effectively managing our time.
The failure to complete the PL in time may have caused greater difficulty in solving these problems.
Regarding the Shared Board Protocol (TCP) we were able to implement it, but it's not fully done. When serializing and deserializing objects throw the net (TCP), we ere unable to do it for
complex objects. However, it is possible to see the server and client connecting, sending and receiving packages.

Although we weren't able to implement everything, it is worth mentioning that:
* We all work in cooperation to successfully complete the project on time;
* Consistent technical decisions among the various group members and meeting the fundamental technical requirements;
* Good team communication, commitment and coordination, some information was decided early in the sprint;
* Consistent technical decisions among the various group members and meeting the fundamental technical requirements;
