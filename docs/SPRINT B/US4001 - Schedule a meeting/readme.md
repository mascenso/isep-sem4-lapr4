| Step 1         | ... interacting with the actor?             | ScheduleMeetingUI                              | UI layer interacts with the user, following the UI pattern.                                                |
|                | ... coordinating the US?                    | ScheduleMeetingController                      | Controller handles the use case, following the Application pattern.                                        |
| Step 2         | get participants to show                    | ScheduleMeetingController/ userRepository      |                                                                                                            |

| Step 5         | Saving the Meeting                          | ScheduleMeetingController / PersistenceContext | Controller collaborates with the PersistenceContext to persist the Meeting.                                |
| Step 6         | show meeting information for user           | ScheduleMeetingUI                              | UI layer displays the course information to the user.                                                      |

### 4.1. Realization

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

*UI Pattern*
*Application patters (controller)*
*Domain Service*
*Factory*
*Persistence patterns*

### 4.4. Tests


## 5. Implementation



## 6. Integration/Demonstration



## 7. Observations

*This US is implemented in a way that validates if users have other meetings at the same time but does not validate if they have classes at the time of the meeting, it is a point to be improved in the next sprint.*
