# US 3003 -  As Project Manager, I want the team to "explore" the synchronization problems related to the shyncronization of shared boards and design a conceptual solution based on practical evidence.

*This is an example template*

## 1. Context

*Explain the context for this task. It is the first time the task is assigned to be developed or this tasks was incomplete in a previous sprint and is to be completed in this sprint? Are we fixing some bug?*

As Project Manager, I want the team to "explore" the synchronization problems related to the synchronization of shared boards and design a conceptual solution based on practical evidence.

This US addresses the problems related with the synchronization of the shared Boards. When a client/User is accessing a shared Board and writing in a Post-It,
no other Client/User should have access to that post-it. The other user must wait for the first one to save the changes.
This way, no information is lost, and it's assured that the post-it is always in an updated state.

## 2. Requirements

*In this section you should present the functionality that is being developed, how do you understand it, as well as possible correlations to other requirements (i.e., dependencies).*

**US3003** As Project Manager, I want the team to "explore" the synchronization problems related to the shyncronization of shared boards and design a conceptual solution based on practical evidence.

-US3003.1 - This functional part of the system has very specific technical requirements, particularly some concerns about synchronization problems.
-US3003.2 - In fact, several clients will try to concurrently update boards. As such, to explore and study this concurrency scenario a "model" of a solution must be implemented and evaluated in C, using processes and semaphores.


## 3. Analysis

*In this section, the team should report the study/analysis/comparison that was done in order to take the best design decisions for the requirement. This section should also include supporting diagrams/artifacts (such as domain model; use case diagrams, etc.),*

- At anytime, the application user (authorized) may want to access an existing post-it of a shared Board.
  For that matter, the access to write in a certain post-it must be exclusive, one user, at a time, can edit the post-it content, so mutex semaphores must be created
  for every post-it available.
- This way, no information is lost, and it's assured that the post-it is always in an updated state.
- It's a must to have this US implemented:
  US3002 - As User, I want to create a board.

**Input Data:**
    * content.

**Output Data:**

* a post-it updated.


**Domain Model Excerpt**

## 4. Design

*In this sections, the team should present the solution design that was adopted to solve the requirement. This should include, at least, a diagram of the realization of the functionality (e.g., sequence diagram), a class diagram (presenting the classes that support the functionality), the identification and rational behind the applied design patterns and the specification of the main tests used to validade the functionality.*
